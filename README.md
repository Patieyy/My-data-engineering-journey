Welcome to my Data Engineering Journey.

This repository documents my learning process as I build foundational knowledge in:

• Python for data processing  
• SQL for data modeling and querying  
• ETL pipeline development  
• Cloud fundamentals (AWS)  
• Computer Science principles  

The goal is to develop strong engineering fundamentals and practical project experience.
